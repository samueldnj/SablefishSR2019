# Conclusions

This paper provides an evaluation of candidate management procedures 
for the Canadian sablefish fishery given updates to the operating 
models and possible addition of at-sea release regulations. 

Stock status: depends on recruitment. Other fisheries deal w similar 
challenges (e.g. hake, GOA sablefish)


MP evaluation: as indicated in previous MSE work, full retention 
of sablefish results in the highest average annual catch, while 
still allowing the fishery to meet conservation objectives in 
both the short and long term. Landed value is also greatest for 
a full retention option. 

MPs 14,3,7 ranked among the top-3 under both reference and robustness 
OMs. However, tuning results in somewhat difference target Fs under 
MP7 F_ref=0.068, F_rob=0.059. This discrepancy could be handled by 
averaging the reference and robustness OMs to account for the high 
uncertainty in Year 2016 recruitment. Revisions to the strategy could 
be made in the next MSE cycle when that recruitment should be better 
estimated.

In the absence of changes to at-sea regulations, the current MP could 
probably stay the same,  since F_ref=0.0589 vs F_rob=0.0524. The average 
would be somewhere near the current target of 5.5%.
