# Conclusions

The current MP for Canadian sablefish (MP15, noCap), involving no limits on at-sea releases, was able to meet conservation objectives under both reference and robustness OMs, although it ranked near the bottom in terms of catch performance compared to MPs with at-sea release regulations. Of the MPs regulating at-sea releases, MP14 (full retention), MP3 (50% cap, historical allocation, and 5-year amortization), and MP7 (100% cap, historical allocation, and 5-year amortization) ranked among the top-3 under both reference and robustness OMs, provided that maximum target fishing mortality rates were tuned to meet conservation objectives. 
As indicated in previous MSE work, full retention MPs result in the highest average annual landed catch while still allowing the fishery to meet conservation objectives in both the short- and long-term. Landed value is also greatest for a full retention MP, suggesting that price premiums that place relatively low value on sub-legal sablefish are not that influential. These results held across reference and robustness OMs. The full retention MP produced 500 t and 310 t more average annual landed catch in the reference and robustness OMs, respectively, compared to the next-best performing MP. Given the current (approximate) price structure for sablefish size, these differences equate to approximately $8.5 million/yr in average annual total landed value under the reference OM and $5.3 million/yr under the robustness OM. 
For MPs not involving full retention, the range of differences in annual average catch among all MPs was only 29 t and 16 t, for reference and robustness OMs, respectively. These equate to approximately $5.6 million/yr in average annual total landed value under the reference OM and $2.4 million/yr under the robustness OM.
The largest conservation risk appears to be tuning an MP to meet conservation objectives under the reference OM only to find out, in the future, that the 2015 year-class was over-estimated, or did not materialize as hoped (which would not be unprecedented in fisheries). We tested the implications of such a scenario by simulating a cross-test of MP performance under the robustness OMs where maximum target fishing mortality was tuned under the reference OMs. As expected, performance against Objective 3 was poor for all MPs in these trials. In addition, most MPs, except full retention, also failed Objective 2 under the robustness OMs by causing relatively high probability of short-term stock declines. Thus, MPs tuned under the reference OMs carry relatively high risks if the 2015 recruitment fails to materialize at 5 times the historical average.
On the other hand, the opposite cross-test — robustness-tuned MPs against the reference OMs — showed that robustness-tuned MPs do exceptionally well against conservation objectives under the reference OMs and still produce 10-year average catch in the 3,400 – 4,200 t range or approximately 90% of the annual yield produced by MPs tuned specifically to the reference OMs. Therefore, the cost in yield of adopting a robustness-tuned MP is relatively low given the high additional certainty regarding conservation performance. These annual yields are still considerably larger than present.
Revisions to the strategy could be made in the next MSE cycle when the 2015 year-class size should be better estimated as several more years of fishery and survey data accumulate.
