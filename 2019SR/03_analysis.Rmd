# Analysis and response

This Science Response uses a closed-loop simulation approach to evaluate the 
relative performance of candidate MPs for the BC sablefish fishery,
using identical methodology to that presented in the previous
MSE cycle [@cox2019evaluating]. The following sub-sections provide 
brief descriptions of the updated data provided for conditioning the 
sablefish operating model, the changes required to fit that data, and 
the new management procedure elements that were tested. Additional 
details of the simulation procedures, diagnostic checks, and 
performance measure calculations are given in @cox2019evaluating.

### Objectives

The specific objectives of this Science Response are to:

1.    Describe operating model fits and inferences after fitting 
(conditioning) to updated biomass indices, catch-at-age, and new 
catch-at-age data derived from length-composition sampling of 
sablefish in the trawl fishery; 
2.    Derive a grid of 5 reference operating models and 5 
robustness trial operating models based on uncertainties about 
Sablefish stock status and productivity (reference OMs) and 
year 2016 recruitment (robustness OMs);
3.    Simulate and rank candidate MPs under the reference and
robustness OMs based on performance against Fishery Objectives
(see below).


## Methods

### Updates to the operating model

Data updated to 2018 included biomass indices and catch-at-age 
for the stratifed random trap survey (StRS), catch-at-age for 
the commercial longline trap fishery, catch and total at-sea 
releases (in biomass units) for the commercial longline trap, 
longline hook, and trawl fisheries. New catch-at-age and 
catch-at-length datasets were obtained for the trawl fishery 
to help estimate trawl selectivity, which is the key 
determinant of sub-legal sablefish catch in trawl fisheries. 
The full trawl catch-at-age dataset (with some missing years) 
was derived from an age-length key given age and length data 
from 1972 to 2017.

A number of small changes were made to the operating model as 
part of routine attempts to improve fits to various data. These 
included (i) changing the functional form of trawl selectivity 
to a gamma density function, (ii) reducing the youngest model 
age class from age-3 to age-2 for all age composition series 
to better reflect the range of age-composition observations, 
(iii) adding new commercial trawl age-composition data (Appendix 
A), (iv) adding an (optional) estimated recruitment deviation in 
2016, rather than using the expected recruitment off the 
stock-recruit curve, (v) updating the ageing-error matrix to use 
a simpler normal approximation a recommended in the previous CSAS
review [@cox2019evaluating]; and (vi) imposing a standard deviation 
of $\sigma = 0.1$ (on the log-scale) on trawl at-sea release 
observation errors to force a better fit to those data. Previous 
models avoided estimating recruitment in the 3 most recent years,
mainly because (i) this would have been the first age-at-entry 
to the observations provided to the model and (ii) there is typically little 
information to support those estimates because fish are too small to 
be selected by the fisheries or surveys. However, for this update, 
we made change (iv) because we needed to improve fits to recent (very 
high) trawl at-sea release observations. Otherwise, we would be 
simulating effects of at-sea releases based on a model that could not 
adequately fit historical at-sea releases. This change has a 
potentially large impact on simulated MP performance and, therefore, 
is a focus of the robustness OMs (described below).


### Operating model scenarios

#### Reference OMs

The reference OMs were derived using the same method as the previous 
MSE cycle (Cox et al. 2019). Briefly, we derive 5 OMs defined by the 
joint posterior distribution of 2018 spawning stock biomass (to reflect 
short-term biological risk) and stock-recruitment steepness (to reflect 
long-term stock productivity risk). The 5 combinations are chosen to 
represent the joint marginal mean of 2018 biomass and steepness and 4 
outer points lying at the intersection of the mean of one variable, 
and the 10th and 90th percentiles of the marginal density of the other 
variable (Figure 1). For each of the 5 posterior points, the operating 
model was conditioned on a sample of 100 posterior draws constrained to 
lie within a Mahalanobis distance of 0.6 units from that point. We then 
used an empirical estimate of the posterior density at each of the 5 
centres as a plausibility score for weighting MP performance across the 
5 OMs within each of the reference and robustness sets (Table 2).

#### Robustness OMs

The robustness OMs were identical to the 5 reference OMs with the exception 
of how Year 2016 recruitment was treated in the OM historical conditioning 
and projections. The reference OM used draws from the joint posterior 
distribution (as defined above) for Year 2016 recruitment, which is 
approximately 12 million fish or about 5 times the historical average. For 
the robustness OMs, we simulated Year 2016 recruitment off the stock-recruitment 
relationship resulting in expected Year 2016 recruitment that was more similar 
to the long-term average ($\sim 2.3$ million). 

### Fishery Objectives

Objectives for the B.C. Sablefish fishery have been developed 
iteratively via consultations between fishery managers, scientists,
and industry stakeholders [@cox2009evaluation; @cox2011management; 
@dfo2014performanc; @cox2019evaluating]. The five primary objectives 
guiding this fishery are:

1.  **P(fSSB > LRP)**: Maintain female spawning stock biomass (fSSB) 
      above the limit reference point $LRP = 0.4B_{MSY}$, where 
      $B_{MSY}$ is the operating model female spawning biomass at maximum 
      sustainable yield ($MSY$), in 95% of years measured over two 
      sablefish generations (36 years);
2.  **P(decline)**: When female spawning stock biomass is between 
      $0.4B_{MSY}$ and $0.8B_{MSY}$, limit the probability of decline over 
      the next 10 years from very low (5%) at $0.4B_{MSY}$ to 
      moderate (50%) at $0.8B_{MSY}$.  At intermediate stock status 
      levels, define the tolerance for decline by linearly 
      interpolating between these probabilities;
3.  **P(fSSB > $B_{MSY}$)**: Maintain the female spawning biomass above 
      a target level of (a) $B_{MSY}$ when inside the healthy zone, 
      or (b) $0.8B_{MSY}$ when rebuilding from the Cautious zone, 
      in the year 2052 with a probability of 50%;
4.  **P(Catch > 1,992 t)**: Minimize probability that annual catch levels 
      are below 1,992 tonnes measured over two sablefish 
      generations. 
5.  **MaxCatch**: Maximize the average annual catch over 10 years 
      subject to Objectives 1-4.

Performance measures corresponding to Objectives 1-4 (in bold) are read as 
"Probability of (condition)". Performance measures are calculated for each 
simulation replicate, and the expected performance for a management procedure 
is summarized by the mean (or median) over the 100 replicates of each simulation. 
Full details of performance measures and calculations are given in @cox2019evaluating.

As noted above, there is a price premium for larger size classes of sablefish, 
which means that the same tonnage of landed catch may yield widely different 
dockside values if the underlying size distributions of individual fish are 
substantially different. This may have consequences for sub-legal regulation
options that require landing small sablefish (e.g., full retention). Therefore,
in addition to presenting catch performance statistics (e.g., Objective 5), we 
also computed cumulative landed value over 10 years and average landed value 
per tonne by fleet (because the size composition of the catch also differs by 
fleet).


### Management procedures

A management procedure (MP) represents a specific, repeatable algorithm for 
computing annual total allowable catches (TACs) in a fishery. In most cases, 
MPs involve monitoring data, assessment methods for processing data and 
estimating stock status, harvest control rules for translating assessment 
outputs into catch limits, and meta rules that may include constraints on 
TAC changes, as well as conditions (e.g., exceptional circumstances) for 
triggering deviations from the standard MP harvest advice.

The MP currently used to set annual sablefish TACs was initially developed 
in Year 2011 and revised in two subsequent MSE iterations. Generally, the 
MP consists of (i) 3 biomass indices; (ii) a surplus production model with 
observation and process errors for estimating stock biomass from the biomass 
indices; (iii) a 60:40 harvest control rule (HCR) in which the maximum 
target harvest rate is adjusted from 5.5% when estimated biomass is above 
60% of estimated $B_{MSY}$, and 0% when the estimated biomass is below 40% 
of $B_{MSY}$; (iv) a meta rule stating that TAC increases are 0 unless the 
HCR recommended increase is more than 200 tonnes (TAC decreases are always 
adopted); and (v) a meta rule adjusting the maximum target fishing mortality 
rate from 9.5% in Year 2017 to 5.5% in Year 2021. Complete details of the 
current MP specifications are given in @cox2019evaluating.

For this Science Response, we evaluated performance of the current MP for 
sablefish, a NoFishing reference case, and 13 variations of the current MP 
that only change at-sea release regulations. The MP variants are constructed 
by combining 3 features: 

1. at-sea sub-legal release cap in which all at-sea releases below the cap 
      may be released without penalty and amounts exceeding the cap go to 
      overages. Caps are noCap, 0%, 50%, 100%, and 150% over the average 
      (VALUE) at-sea releases that occurred between 2006 and 2018. The 
      current MP involves no cap (unlimited at-sea releases without penalty), 
      while a full retention (frt) case allows no at-sea releases (all fish 
      brought on-board vessels must be landed and counted against the TAC). 
2. fixed allocations of the total at-sea release cap to each fleet (i.e., 
      trap, longline hook, trawl). Allocations are computed based on either
      recent (rct = $(23\%, 18\%, 59\%)$ )  or historical 
      (hst = $(30\%, 37\%, 33\%)$ ) fleet-specific average proportions of 
      the total annual at-sea releases.
3. amortization period of either 5 (am5) or 10 (am10) years over which to 
      spread at-sea release overages to future TACs. 


Our naming convention for MPs attempts to describe the at-sea release 
regulations by concatenating CAP_ALLOCATION_AMORTIZATION settings. For 
example, the **cap.5_hstAl_am5** MP involves a total at-sea release cap that 
is 50% of the historical average (**cap.5**), a cap allocation among fleets 
that is computed from the historical, fleet-specific average proportions
(**hstAl**), and a 5-year amortization period for at-sea release overages 
(**am5**). The two special cases are the current MP (**noCap**), which has no 
cap, and full retention (frt), which has no releases. 

#### A worked example at-sea release regulation for **cap.5_hstAl_am5**.

Here we provide the sequence of calculations used to establish annual at-sea 
release caps and then how they affect future TAC allocations. In the 
computations below, the following notation applies: $t$ is Year, $g$ is fleet, 
$p(g)$ is allocation proportion for fleet $g$, and $\bar{R}$ is the average 
total (over all fleets) at-sea releases between 2006 and 2018.

1.    Calculate 50% at-sea release CAP for year and fleet:
\begin{equation*}
            CAP(t,g) = 0.5 \cdot \bar{R} x p(g).
\end{equation*}
2.    Run simulation for year t to get actual at-sea releases: $R(t,g)$.
3.    Calculate overage $o(t,g)$ for the year as the difference between 
      actual releases $R(t,g)$ and the $CAP(t,g)$:  $o(t,g) = R(t,g) - CAP(t,g)$
4.    Amortization period is 5 years, so add 1/5th of this year's overage.
      to the accumulated overage account $O(t,g)$ in each of the next 5 years: 
\begin{equation*}
      O(t',g) = O(t',g) + o(t,g)/5, \mbox{ for } t' = t+1, ..., t+5.
\end{equation*}
5.    Get adjusted legal-sized sablefish TAC for next year by subtracting 
      overage account for that year from initial TAC' (TAC' set by the MP 
      prior to at-sea regulations): $TAC(t,g) = TAC'(t,g) - O(t,g)$.


This approach aims to create an incentive to avoid sub-legal sablefish via 
future TAC reductions (using a one-for-one accounting of sub-legal biomass 
to legal sized sablefish biomass), while also allowing some flexibility 
year-to-year for unpredictably large at-sea releases in any given year. Note 
that the overage account can never be less than zero, so that TACs cannot be 
increased above the initial TAC set by the first stage MP.

### Management procedure tuning

There are five primary dimensions of MP performance against objectives. The 
first three represent biomass conservation performance against the LRP, 
short-term probability of decline, and achieving a long-term target near 
$B_{MSY}$, while the fourth and fifth dimensions relate to maintaining catch 
levels above an industry-preferred floor and short-term average catch. It 
is rare that two MPs would have comparable performance across four of these 
objectives while only differing on one. If this were the case, then MP 
decisions would be straightforward – choose the MP with better performance 
on the fifth criterion. Unfortunately, MPs typically differ on all 5 dimensions 
simultaneously, which makes it difficult to compare performance without, at 
least, establishing some equivalency between conservation probabilities 
(performance dimensions 1-3) and short-term average catch (performance 
dimension 5). 

Management procedure tuning provides a means of establishing equivalent MP 
performance against objectives for which the values and probabilities are 
well established.  For example, maintaining the sablefish stock above the 
LRP ($0.4B_{MSY}$) with high probability has not been openly debated since 
it is an overarching Canadian policy directive in the sablefish fishery 
context (at least not debated over the 10+ year history of the sablefish 
MSE). Similarly, maintaining a low probability of short-term decline has 
also not been debated, probably because avoiding further decline has been 
the key overriding objective of the sablefish fishing industry since the 
inception of the MSE process. Objective 3 – spawning biomass in the healthy 
zone within 2 generations – has been debated over the years for practical 
reasons. Specifically, there is concern that achieving Objective 3 would 
require severe short-term catch restrictions for highly uncertain long-term 
benefits. Over the past year, the sablefish industry and DFO Science and 
Management agreed to revise Objective 3 to achieve biomass in the healthy 
zone by a specific end-year (2052) with at least 50% probability, i.e., 
median fSSB at, or above, $B_{MSY}$. As we demonstrate below, this objective 
is now feasible given sablefish dynamics and also achievable for a range of 
realistic MPs. However, this raises a new question: how much is it worth 
(i.e., in catch) to improve Objective 3 performance from, say, 
$P(B_{2052} \geq B_MSY) = 0.5$ to $P(B_{2052} \geq B_MSY) = 0.55$? The probability 
difference of only 5 percentage points could mean a difference of several 
hundred tonnes in average annual catch, which would cumulatively added up 
to tens of millions of dollars in landed value. MPs that are better at 
Objective 3 do so at the expense of Objectives 4 and 5. 

We aimed to simplify interpretation of MP performance by tuning all MPs to 
a standard $P(B_{2052} \geq B_MSY) = 0.5$, which ensures that all MPs under 
consideration meet all the stated conservation objectives under the reference
OMs and only differ in their catch performance. This simplification is needed 
in the current context, because the at-sea regulations we evaluated have catch 
and fishing opportunity implications across fishing sectors.

Tuning was achieved by iteratively adjusting Year 2022 phased-in maximum target 
fishing mortality rates $F_{2022}$ until each MP met the lower limit of Objective 
3, i.e., $P(B_{2052} \geq B_{MSY}) = 0.5$. We tuned the surplus production model 
management procedures separately to the reference OM (**hiRec2016**) and robustness 
OM (**simRec2016**) scenarios, leading to different $F_{2022}$ values under each 
recruitment scenario. Note that this target maximum harvest rate replaces the 
final maximum target rate of 5.5% after the 5-year phase-in from 2017
[@cox2019evaluating]

The most critical, and perhaps unrealistic in some cases, assumption in the above 
is that fleets stop fishing when their fleet-specific TACs are fully landed.

## Results



### Operating model update and implications for stocks status


### Management Procedure Evaluation Results

#### Reference oeprating model set

Year 2016 recruitment is a main driver of spawning biomass and fishery outcomes in 
the reference OM simulations. Given the high 2016 recruitment, spawning biomass
increases rapidly over the first 5 years of the projection period as these fish 
become fully recruited to the fisheries and then the spawning biomass (Fig). Spawning 
biomass then trends downward toward $B_{MSY}$ in the long-term as this large year class 
is fished down. Under these conditions, all MPs met all the conservation criteria 
defined by Objectives 1-3. The probability of catch below the 1,992 t floor was 
2.6% or less across all MPs. Tuning MPs to meet Objectives 1-3, and specifically 
treating Objective 3 as a target, highlights MP performance differences in average 
annual catch over the next 10 years.

As expected, management procedures with more restricted at-sea release regulations 
ranked higher in terms of 10-year average catch (Table X) with the values ranging 
from 4,510 t per year for full retention (**frt**) to 3,700 t per year for a cap 150% 
higher than average, recent cap allocation among fleets (i.e., allocating 59% to 
trawl), and 5-year amortization (MP13 **cap1.5_rctAl_am5**).  This difference is 
attributable to two factors. First, the key assumption here is that fishing activity 
stops once the TAC is reached, so full retention involves less mortality of sub-legal 
fish over all fleets. This leads to a large reduction in growth overfishing for the 
full retention regulation – gains in sablefish body growth are much higher than 
losses due to natural mortality in sub-legal size classes – and, therefore, average 
weight of legal-sized fish in the catch is larger. Second, the fishery can operate at 
higher fishing mortality rates because survival over sub-legal size classes is higher 
and therefore higher survival to fisheries and the spawning stock. Indeed, the current 
MP maximum target $F = 5.5\%$ is largely the result of lower survival through sub-legal 
size classes, which inhibits MPs from meeting the future spawning biomass Objective 
3. In contrast, the full retention MP meets Objective 3 despite a maximum target 
4. $F = 7.4\%$ (Table X).

Differences in average annual catch were smaller among at-sea regulation options not 
involving full retention. An at-sea release cap of 50% of the historical average 
resulted in average annual catch levels approximately 200 t higher than the current 
MP (**noCap**), regardless of how the cap in the former was allocated among fleets (MP3 
and MP5 vs MP15; Table X). 

An at-sea release cap equal to 100% of the historical average also produced 200 t 
more average annual catch compared to the current MP, as long as the cap was allocated 
according to the historical at-sea release proportions and amortized over 5 years. The 
similarity to the lower 50% caps described above mainly reflects cap allocation to the 
trawl fleet, where the recent allocation (57%) is approximately twice the historical 
(29%), so switching to the lower, historical allocation allows for doubling the cap, 
i.e., the total at-sea release amounts allocated to the trawl fleet are similar. In 
general, the historical allocation options ranked higher than the recent allocations 
because the historical allocation involves lower at-sea releases by the trawl fleet. 
The amortization period did not have as noticeable an effect as the overall cap and 
allocation options, in that order.

Increasing the cap to 150% of the historical average produced the lowest average annual 
catch, despite the current MP having no cap at all. Although average 10-year catches 
were similar, at-sea releases in the current MP (**noCap**) change mainly with recruitment 
and therefore have less impact than a 150% cap, which decouples at-sea releases and 
recruitment to some (small) degree and allows trawl fishing to continue past current 
sub-legal catch rates. 

For higher caps and recent at-sea release allocation, the effect of amortization switched 
from 5 years being better to 10 years being better. Although the differences were small 
(MP 12 vs MP13; Table X), the switch probably occurs because there is little to no 
growth overfishing benefit of amortization at high caps and recent allocations, which 
would mean higher trawl releases than present. In this case, the amortization period 
has a direct effect on TACs with longer amortization periods having less impact 
because any overages are spread over the longer period.

We initially expected that a full retention and/or lower cap regulations would negatively 
affect fishery landed value because the landed catch would consist of higher proportions 
of sub-legal fish. Price premiums for sablefish (see table below; C. Acheson per comm., 
Spring 2019) may result in several dollars per pound differences between sub-legal 
(< 3 lbs) and legal-sized sablefish.

**TABLE OF SABLEFISH VALUES**

Indeed, the average landed value per tonne was approximately $170 lower for a 
full retention trap fishery compared to any of the other at-sea release 
regulations (Table X), while landed value was approximately $20 and $90 
per tonne lower for longline hook and trawl landings, respectively. 
Size-selectivity for trap, and especially longline hook, fisheries is shifted 
far enough toward larger sizes that the impacts of retaining smaller fish are 
relatively small compared to the benefits of higher average TACs. Indeed, 
cumulative landed values over ten years were $47 million, $18 million, and 
$15 million higher for trap, longling hook, and trawl fisheries under full 
retention fishery compared to the next best average annual catch regulation 
option (i.e., MP3, **cap.5_hstAl_am5**). 

The next best at-sea release regulation option after full retention was very 
different between trap and longline hook fisheries and trawl. For instance, 
as noted above MP3 (cap.5_hstAl_am5) was the next best option for trap and 
longline hook, in terms of both average annual TAC and cumulative value 
(Table X). In contrast, the next best option for trawl landed value was 
MP13 (**cap1.5_rctAl_am5**), which had the lowest average annual TAC. The value 
difference for trawl between this option and full retention was only $5 
million over 10 years, while the value differences between MP3 and MP13 
for trap and longline hook were $33 million and $32 million, respectively. 
Thus, trap and longline hook fisheries benefit from more restrictive at-sea 
regulations while trawl benefits from the least restrictive, even without 
considering the implications for trawl's main target fisheries.


#### Robustness operating model set

Unlike the reference OMs, in which biomass and catch increases are large 
over the next decade, sablefish biomass and catch projections under the 
robustness OMs increased more gradually and generally required lower 
fishing rates. In fact, these simulations closely resemble previous sablefish 
MSE results in suggesting relatively conservative harvest strategies. 

Tuning MPs to meet Objective 3 under the robustness OMs was more challenging 
because higher Fs had more noticeable impacts on the short term decline 
objective (P(decline); Table X). MP tuning produced relatively low target 
fishing mortality rates ranging from 5.24% (current MP) to 6.7% (full 
retention). Whereas the probability of catches less than 1,992 t (Objective 
4) were negligible (< 3%) in the reference OMs, they were all greater than 
17% in the robustness OMs except for full retention, which was 8% (Table X). 

Average annual catch under the robustness OMs ranged from 2,310 t under 
the current MP (MP15, noCap) to 2,770 t under full retention. Thus, the 
current MP with no limit on at-sea releases performed worse than any of 
the cap options, although most of the differences between cap options and 
the current MP were 80 t or less (Table X). There was a slight difference 
in the rank order of MPs (ranked by average 10-year catch) under the 
robustness OMs, although the absolute difference among most MPs was small.

Annual TACs were also more sensitive to variation in the MP data as indicated 
by higher average annual variation in catch (AAV), which was 14-16% under 
the robustness OMs compared to 7-9% under the reference OMs. This probably 
occurs because the stock is sometimes assessed below BMSY, leading to changes 
in both stock status and the maximum target fishing mortality, which has been 
relatively common in realized applications of sablefish MPs.

Cumulative 10-year landed value under the robustness OMs was approximately 
60% of landed value in the reference OMs. Although the absolute scales differ, 
the cumulative value patterns were similar to the reference set; that is, 
full retention produced the highest overall value, as well as value in each 
fleet, and the next best at-sea release regulation option was the least 
restrictive for trawl and next-most-restrictive for trap and longline hook.
